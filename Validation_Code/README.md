This folder contains the data and notebooks used to validate the CIDRE algorithm.

Folder info:

"Data": Contains data files such as edge files for the 2013 and 2020 journal networks and JCR suppressions for validating CIDRE.

"Validation Examples": Contains a "Replicate_Experiments" Python notebook that applies CIDRE to a cleaned dataset created by the original authors using the MAG data set for 2013 journals. It also contains a "Reproduce_Experiments" Python notebook that applies CIDRE to the new, unseen data of 2020 journals that was collected and cleaned by myself (Gregory Lister Pollard).
